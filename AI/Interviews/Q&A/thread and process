thread is the path of execution within a process
 a process can contain multiple threads
 the threads within the same process run in a shared 
 memory space while processes run in seperate memory spaces
 threads are not independent of one other like processes
 
 when two thread access the code in the same time 
 it caused race condition for example when two 
 thread access a global static variable and add it the 
 same time it may be wrong ,one of the solution is add the 
 synchronized lock
